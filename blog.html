	<h><strong>Challenges/trouble and my solutions:</strong></h>
	<p>I haven't used git in a while so it took me some time to get used to pushing and commiting through putty on the engr servers.
	Once I looked through the help docs I got back into it relatively quick</p>
	<h><strong>What did I learn from this assignment and what did I already know:</strong></h>
	<p>Other than touching up on my git skills everything was pretty familiar to me. It felt a little weird trying to style without css but thats about it.
	I have never used piazza though and it seems like an easy way to help out classmates, I intend on using it as often as possible</p>
	<h><strong>What resources where the most helpful for this assignment:</strong></h>
	<p>I mostly used the W3 schools website to help me remember all the html and I used the git help in terminal to assist me with git.
	Both where very helpful and all I really needed to get going.</p>
